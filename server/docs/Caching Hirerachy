There are 4 main caching classes in redis package, that inherit from the master class "Cache". Each sub class creates a connection to Redis from the connection pool to support multithreaded redis

User caching:
User is cached as a hash set being "user:$id" where $id is a var representing user id and containing all details of user

Tweets caching:
Tweets are cached as a hash set being "tweet:$id" where $id is a var representing tweet id and containing all details of tweet

Lists caching:
Lists are cached as a hash set being "list:$id" where $id is a var representing list id and containing all details of list

User Tweets Caching
Each user has a seperate redis set in the form "usertweets:$id" where $id is a var for user id and the set contains ONLY tweet ids, which can be fetched from tweets hashes.

User Following Caching
Each user has a seperate redis set in the form "userfollowing:$id" where $id is a var for user id and the set contains ONLY user ids which are being followed, which can be fetched from users hashes.

User Followers Caching
Each user has a seperate redis set in the form "userfollowers:$id" where $id is a var for user id and the set contains ONLY user ids which are followers of user, which can be fetched from users hashes.

Session caching is NOT implemented yet
