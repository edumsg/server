Self implemented cron can be found in the redis package in EduMsgRedis.

Currently the following is implemented:

1) Auto Background Save
Background Save is performed, every 15 minutes in a non-blocking fashion. The location of the save file is define be Redis' configuration file, in linux generally it will be under /etc/redis.conf (depends on distro), under windows you will find it in Chocolatey's (windows package manager) folder, not sure where under OS X or other Unix systems.
